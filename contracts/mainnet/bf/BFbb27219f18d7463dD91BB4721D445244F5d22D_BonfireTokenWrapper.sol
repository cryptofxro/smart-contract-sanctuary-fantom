/**
 * The idea here is for this contract to receive any IERC20 Token, keep it and
 * send a share amount to a given address, upon request from this address it
 * can then again be withdrawn.
 * The share amounts are computed at each withdraw/deposit transaction.
 * Particularly for UniswapV2Pair.swap() calls we need a two step version.
 * Receivers need to implement the IBonfireProxyToken interface.
 * Multichain ProxyTokens (IMultichainToken interface) can mint
 * BonfireTokenWrapper on chains that are not their source chain.
 * The intention is that holders of the wrapped Tokens are Token contracts
 * only. That way the wrapped Token logic and the wrapping logic are
 * independent from each other and easier to verify.
 *
 * Withdraw and withdrawFrom use the same burnShares(from, amount, to)
 * proxyToken function. Proxy tokens need to make sure that allowances are
 * matched if sender and from addresses differ.
 *
 * The BonfireTokenTracker is a contract that for the purpose of this wrapper
 * contract returns a burn wallet address receiving reflection Tokens. The
 * purpose of the tracker is to make sure such observer wallets are referenced
 * in a decentralized way. We use observer wallets to track life reflection
 * instead of percentage values, because it's harder to manipulate and does not
 * require monitoring of excluded wallets.
 * Noteworthy, this technique only works post transaction.
 * For regular Tokens (fixed taxes) an attacker could additionally burn Tokens
 * to the observer wallet for an announced deposit to increase the shares
 * attributed to the current holders. But the attacker cannot decrease the
 * amount received by the observer and can thus not decrease the reflections
 * being attributed to previous proxy Token holders.
 *
 * Deposits and Withdrawals
 * ------------------------
 *
 * Withdrawals from the wrapper are the easy part. We burn wrapped Tokens and
 * release Tokens according to the shares to the recipient. This works (almost)
 * seamless also for allowances. The only minor trouble there is that we need
 * to forward the caller and the assumed sender (msg.sender and sender in
 * _withdrawShares) to the IBonfireProxyToken of interest, since
 * wrapping/unwrapping has to be handled by the BonfireTokenWrapper, while
 * approvals are handled by the IBonfireProxyToken.
 *
 * Deposits are in the general use case a bit more complicated, in particular
 * for Tokens that have more interesting Tokenomics. Common wrapped Tokens,
 * such as wBNB can do this process on the fly, for instance have an account
 * submit BNB to a DEX, have the DEX contract send the BNB to the WBNB contract
 * in exchange for wBNB, have the DEX swap the wBNB for some ExemplaryToken
 * (ET) via sending it to an LP; the ET are now in the calling contracts
 * holdings, the calling contract can now send the ET to a wrapping contract
 * and receive wET in return. Noteworthy, this has two ET transfers happening.
 *
 * For taxed Tokens we want as little as possible Token transfers, so actually
 * only one. In above scenario with two ET transfers we otherwise receive an
 * unfortunate outcome.
 *
 * DEXes built in the shape of Uniswap do allow function calls for the
 * receiver, which would allow to build the functionality for taxed Tokens. But
 * for reflection Tokens this approach does not suffice. For reflection Tokens
 * we have to assume that Token balances increase even if there is no
 * interaction with the TokenWrapper.
 *
 * Before and after each transaction intended for wrapping Tokens we need to
 * track the Token balances of the TokenWrapper contract by the TokenWrapper
 * contract.
 *
 * There are two possible scenarios to deal with this. The first one and more
 * direct is to have the TokenWrapper initiate the swap. This would either
 * require to allow arbitrary external function calls from the TokenWrapper or
 * have knowledge over DEX contracts. Aribtrary external function calls we want
 * to avoid for security concerns, specialised DEX knowledge is very specific
 * and not future proof. The second possibility is to have two-step deposits
 * as implemented in this contract First, announceDeposit to check a
 * beforeBalance, and then executeDeposit, to check afterBalance and finalise
 * the deposit.
 *
 * The intended use of announceDeposit() and executeDeposit() is not only to
 * happen in the same block, but actually within the very same transaction.
 * Hence the described scenario with a hacker executing an attack in between is
 * only possible if a contract implementing a two-step deposit is designed out
 * of the assumed scope.
 *
 * Noteworthy here is an attack someone might be thinking about when reading
 * this. A miner could initiate an announceDeposit() at the beginning of a
 * block containing a huge Token transfer (of some reflection Token) and close
 * the block with an executeDeposit() call. On first sight this seems to imply
 * the reflection gains of that very Token transfer to be solely distributed to
 * that miner. However, by the computations of this contract (and Tokens that
 * have set up a correct observer wallet in BonfireTokenTracker) we are able to
 * distinguish correctly between reflections and incoming transfers. That's
 * sort of the whole point of the construction.
 *
 * Note on Multichain Tokens
 * -------------------------
 *
 * At the time of writing there is no fullfledged solution to ensure that
 * bridges can verifiy Token addresses across blockchains. This becomes
 * especially evident when considering non-EVM-based blockchains. If it was
 * EVM-based blockchains only, we could simply require that contract addresses
 * be the same. The secureBridge variable is dedicated to future solutions that
 * fulfill this requirement.
 * Until then, we need to handle bridgeAllowances. This means that wrapped
 * Multichain Tokens (as intended by this contract) have to create the
 * Token contracts, apply to the bridges and apply to the Bonfire network in
 * order to enable cross-chain transfers.
 *
 * For the time being the Bonfire network is likely to approve only one
 * Multichain Token for each wrapped sourceToken. Given the moveShares function
 * this already allows arbitrary proxyTokens to indirectly move from chain to
 * chain (via conversion to that dedicated multichain token that is).
 *
 * The MultichainToken contract as created by the MultichainTokenFactory does
 * its best to ensure plausible cross-chain activity, but it does not need to
 * be "the" dedicated cross-chain proxy Token contract for all projects. Other
 * Token contracts however need some extended form of auditing. In particular,
 * for each mint we require calling of the reportMint function, for each burn
 * we require calling of the reportBurn function. Obviously the function
 * calling the reportBurn is of particular interest here.
 *
 * Also note, that there is an intended backdoor to making other proxyTokens
 * more cross-chainy. That is, the MultichainToken.burn function does not
 * require bridge access rights, and even increases the corresponding
 * bridgeAllowance. For one, users who accidentally (or intentionally burn
 * their standard MultichainToken tokens, can at a later stage mint the same
 * amount. For another, if a third party ProxyToken (derived from an approved
 * MultichainTokenFactory) dedicates liquidity on the sourceChain to be locked
 * in a bridge contract and liquidity on a different chain to be burned
 * (different form of lock), it can effectively serve to allow cross-chain
 * transfers (in line with the locked liquidity) for this proxyToken directly.

         * do it in the next block anyway (executeDeposit() requirement), and
         * most people don't control transaction orderings in the blocks.
         * Meaning, if you split those two functions into separate
         * transactions, you open the doors for (admittedly very unlikely) MEV
         * attacks.
         *
         * The twoStepLock also checks if the caller is a contract, preventing
         * regular users to call announce and execute functions. It does not
         * verify (1) whether the caller is the same for both functions, and it
         * does neither verify (2) whether already another announceDeposit call
         * might be in progress.
         *
         * (1) This means, that the execute call is allowed to come from a
         * different contract. This check seems unecessary since correct calls
         * are from within the same transaction anyway, so an attack here would
         * require the initial caller to call malicious contracts in the first
         * place, and even give these malicious contracts sufficiant allowance
         * over their funds.
         *
         * (2) Since malicious contracts could announce a deposit and never
         * execute it, any other behaviour would
         * - either restrict the calling capabilities (and allow attackers to
         * prevent other 2-step deposits in the same block),
         * - or unnecessarily bloat this contract's storage (and introduce
         * something like mapping(mapping) structures to handle deposits more
         * specifically. In particular it would make 2-step deposits for all
         * users quite a bit more expensive.
         * The specific implementation thus does not allow to announce a second
