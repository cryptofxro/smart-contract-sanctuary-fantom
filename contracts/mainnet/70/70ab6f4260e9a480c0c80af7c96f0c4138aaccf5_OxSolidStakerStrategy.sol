    ===== Badger Base Strategy =====
    Common base class for all Sett strategies

    Changelog
    V1.1
    - Verify amount unrolled from strategy positions on withdraw() is within a threshold relative to the requested amount as a sanity check
    - Add version number which is displayed with baseStrategyVersion(). If a strategy does not implement this function, it can be assumed to be 1.0

    V1.2
    - Remove idle want handling from base withdraw() function. This should be handled as the strategy sees fit in _withdrawSome()

    V1.5
    - No controller as middleman. The Strategy directly interacts with the vault
    - withdrawToVault would withdraw all the funds from the strategy and move it into vault
    - strategy would take the actors from the vault it is connected to
        - SettAccessControl removed
    - fees calculation for autocompounding rewards moved to vault
    - autoCompoundRatio param added to keep a track in which ratio harvested rewards are being autocompounded
