    @notice: This contract serves as the router/minter for the Character NFT. It communicates with the VRF contract,
    performs the necessary calculations to determine the character's properties and stats and ultimately calls the mint 
    function of the NFT contract with the calculated results as arguments. Only this contract can call the NFT's mint function
    and only one router at a time can be set in the NFT contract as well.
